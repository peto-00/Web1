  <h2>L'Afrique</h2>
  <p><strong>I am really curious about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa' target='_blank' title='wikipedia_Africa'>Africa<a>, about the continent.</strong><br>
  I want to know more about its history, its culture and people living there.<br>
  I want to work in some parts of Africa, someday in my life. I want to travel in there.<br>
  It's a sort of groundless love.<br>
  However, it does not mean that I am not scared of malaria and yellow fever. Actually, I am a coward.</p>

  <p>Above all, it's a good thing that there is something which consistently catches my eyes.<br>
    It's a good thing that I become having interests about a subject.<br>
    In this folder 'L'Afrique', I want to scrab manifold information about Africa.
    Because I want to leave some memories of my passion toward Africa, and want to share them with others who are also interested in these stuffs.<br>
    The reason why I created the name of the folder, L'Afrique is that simply, I love French.</p>
