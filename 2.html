  <h2>Le FranÇais</h2>
  <p><strong>It was...when I was 16 years old..that I first met French.</strong><br>
  It was not my will to learn French. I entered into a foreign language highschool and my major was English. And all the English-Major students were obligated to study French.<br>
  Actually, at first, and during 3 years of highschool, French was not my type. I didn't like it that much. Because, my French grades were always bad and the atmosphere was so competitive.<br>
  After I graduated highschool, however, French came to be seen different. I realized that it was a language that has a beautiful pronounciation and also, I fell in love with french films.<br>
  Since then, I have signed up for French classes in the university listening to french chansons, watching french films, dramas.</p>

  <p>But, to be real, I'm still not very good at French, though I have known French for 4 years.<br>
    I don't know why I keep being attracted to French, however, I want to be more good at it. I made a goal: I will get DELF B2 till the end of 2020!<br>
    For acheiving that goal, I'm gonna note various things about French.<br></p>
